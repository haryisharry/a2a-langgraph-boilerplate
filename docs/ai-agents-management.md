# AI Agents Management

This guide covers how to create, configure, and manage individual AI agents within the A2A LangGraph Boilerplate system.

## What is an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an autonomous entity that can:
- **Process tasks** assigned by the supervisor or user
- **Use tools** to interact with external systems
- **Communicate** with other agents in the crew
- **Maintain context** across conversations
- **Execute specialized functions** based on its role

## Agent Architecture

### Core Components

Each agent consists of:
- **Identity**: Name, role, and description
- **Instructions**: System prompt defining behavior and capabilities
- **Model**: Specific LLM model to use (OpenRouter integration)
- **Tools**: External capabilities accessible through MCP servers
- **Crew Association**: Link to parent crew for coordination

### Agent Types

#### Supervisor Agent
- **Role**: Coordinates and delegates tasks
- **Responsibilities**: Planning, task distribution, result synthesis
- **Automatically created** when a crew is formed

#### Specialized Agents
- **Role**: Perform specific types of tasks
- **Examples**: Researcher, Developer, Analyst, Writer
- **Custom specializations** based on system instructions

    "general": "google/gemini-2.5-flash",     # Fast and cost-effective
}
```

## Managing Agent Tools

### Adding Tools to Agents

```python
# Add a specific tool to an agent
response = requests.post(f"http://localhost:8000/agents/{agent_id}/tools/{tool_id}")
updated_agent = response.json()
```

### Tool Assignment Strategy

```python
# Research agent tools
research_tools = ["web_search", "academic_search", "fact_checker"]

# Developer agent tools  
developer_tools = ["code_analyzer", "documentation_generator", "test_runner"]

# Analyst agent tools
analyst_tools = ["data_processor", "chart_generator", "statistical_analyzer"]

# Assign tools based on agent role
for tool_name in research_tools:
    # Get tool by name and assign to research agent
    pass
```

### Dynamic Tool Management

```python
# Check agent's current tools
response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/agents/{agent_id}")
agent = response.json()
current_tools = agent.get('tools', [])

# Add new tools based on requirements
new_tools = ["advanced_analyzer", "report_generator"]
for tool_name in new_tools:
    # Add tool to agent
    pass
```

## Agent Operations

### Updating Agent Configuration

```python
# Update agent settings
update_data = {
    "name": "Senior Research Analyst",
    "role": "senior_researcher",
    "model": "google/gemini-1.5-pro",
    "system_instructions": "Updated instructions with advanced capabilities...",
    "crew_id": crew_id
}

response = requests.put(f"http://localhost:8000/agents/{agent_id}", json=update_data)
updated_agent = response.json()
```

### Agent Performance Monitoring

```python
# Get agent details including performance metrics
response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/agents/{agent_id}")
agent_details = response.json()

# Monitor agent usage in conversations
response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/conversations/")
conversations = response.json()

# Filter conversations involving this agent
agent_conversations = [conv for conv in conversations if conv.get('agent_id') == agent_id]
```

## Agent Communication

### Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate through the supervisor using the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol:

1. **Supervisor receives** user request
2. **Supervisor delegates** tasks to appropriate agents
3. **Agents execute** tasks and report back
4. **Supervisor synthesizes** results

### Message Flow

```python
# Example communication flow
workflow = {
    "1": "User submits query to crew",
    "2": "Supervisor analyzes request",
    "3": "Supervisor delegates to Research Agent",
    "4": "Research Agent executes search and analysis",
    "5": "Research Agent reports findings to Supervisor", 
    "6": "Supervisor delegates to Analyst Agent for deeper analysis",
    "7": "Analyst Agent processes data and generates insights",
    "8": "Supervisor synthesizes all results",
    "9": "Final response delivered to user"
}
```

## Advanced Agent Features

### Custom Agent Classes

For specialized use cases, you can create custom agent implementations:

```python
# Example of specialized agent configuration
specialized_agent = {
    "name": "AI Ethics Advisor",
    "role": "ethics_advisor", 
    "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet",
    "system_instructions": """You are an AI ethics advisor responsible for:
    
    ETHICAL REVIEW:

    - Check accessibility requirements
    - Validate consent mechanisms
    
    RECOMMENDATIONS:
    - Suggest ethical improvements
    - Provide mitigation strategies
    - Recommend best practices
    - Guide responsible AI development""",
    "crew_id": crew_id
}
```

### Agent Memory and Context

Agents maintain context through:
- **Conversation history**: Previous interactions
- **Tool usage history**: What tools were used and results
- **Task history**: Previous tasks and outcomes
- **Learning patterns**: Improved responses over time

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Performance optimization strategies
optimization_tips = {
    "model_selection": "Choose appropriate models for agent tasks",
    "instruction_clarity": "Write clear, specific system instructions",
    "tool_efficiency": "Assign relevant tools to reduce overhead",
    "context_management": "Optimize context length for better performance",
    "caching": "Cache frequent operations for faster responses"
}
```

## Troubleshooting Agents

### Common Issues

1. **Agent Not Responding**
   - Check crew assignment
   - Verify system instructions
   - Ensure model availability

2. **Poor Task Performance**
   - Review and improve system instructions
   - Verify appropriate tools are assigned
   - Consider model upgrade

3. **Tool Access Errors**
   - Check MCP server connectivity
   - Verify tool permissions
   - Review tool configurations

### Debugging Steps

```python
# Debug agent configuration
def debug_agent(agent_id):
    # Get agent details
    response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/agents/{agent_id}")
    agent = response.json()
    
    print(f"Agent: {agent['name']}")
    print(f"Role: {agent['role']}")
    print(f"Model: {agent.get('model', 'default')}")
    print(f"Crew: {agent['crew_id']}")
    print(f"Tools: {len(agent.get('tools', []))}")
    
    # Check crew status
    crew_response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/crews/{agent['crew_id']}")
    crew = crew_response.json()
    print(f"Crew: {crew['name']} with {len(crew.get('agents', []))} agents")
    
    return agent, crew
```

## Best Practices
